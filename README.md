# Heavy-Metal-Player
A Windows program that plays the Metal Pipe Falling sound effect.

## Installation
You can run the program by double-clicking it, as it requires no installation.

## Usage
You can either make the sound play periodically every x seconds or you can specify a random interval (a random number within the range will be generated).
If you click the hide button, the window will disappear; to actually close it, you'll need to end the process from the task manager or with the following command: `taskkill /im "Heavy Metal Player.exe"`
